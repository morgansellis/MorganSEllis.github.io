## This is my personal blog/website/coding rant space

## This website is built using Jekyll and the Hydeout theme

Hydeout updates the original [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde)
theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) 3.x and adds new functionality.

If you want to play around with github.io pages then [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a good place to start and there are plenty of themes out there to choose from. I for some reason felt compelled to use one that had both a side bar and categories. So far it's been a great expereince, so the above theme is great for me.
