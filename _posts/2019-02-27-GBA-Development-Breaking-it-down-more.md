Ok so one thing I'd like to aim to do is to keep my tutorial videos shorter than 30 minutes a piece. Ideally I'd like them to be less than 20 minutes each to watch, as I feel anything longer than that might lose it's focus.  
I much prefer to break a task down into smaller parts with a single focus.  
Hopefully if you're going to be watching the series you have a similar opinion.  With that in mind I'm going to break the tutorial video for implementing Pong down into two parts, which it admittedly should have always been.  
The first part will be how to create a simple pixel plotter to draw individual pixels and then, plotting lines and boxes.  
I've uploaded to completed code for these two tutorials, with the third part covering input soon to follow. The YouTube clips will be going up soon for the first one, which I've been a little bit tardy in getting up on time, but hopefully all will be forgiven once some steady and regular updates begin to appear.  
It's been a busy week at work and that led to this being slightly delayed.  
I'll remedy that quite soon.
