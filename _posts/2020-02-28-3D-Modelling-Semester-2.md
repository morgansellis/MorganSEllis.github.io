For my semester 2 project in 3D modelling I need to create a 3D character and a scene that reflected the theme of lost treasure. My choice of lost treasure was a cure to a disease that had been taken and needed to be retrieved to save humanity.

The requirements on the assignment was for the character model to be 9,000 polys or less and the environment to be 50,000 polys or less. In total my scene was 35,000 polys.
