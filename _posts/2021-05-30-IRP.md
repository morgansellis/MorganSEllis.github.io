As part of this module, I had to choose an aspect of the industry that interested me and write a fully referenced and researched paper with an output design that demonstrated the practical aspects of the research paper. My chosen topic was Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA), what is a broad term give to a system within a video game that reacts to the competence of the player and then reacts accordingly.

For the written aspect of this assignment, I received 80/100. Additionally, my research paper was nominated for 'Best Innovation and Research Award' at COMX which is an event hosted by the University of Gloucestershire that allows students from all years to present their work in industry professionals and other members of Creative Computing.
