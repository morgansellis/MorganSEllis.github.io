During the first lecture of level design of semester two our assignment was told to me. I would need to create a game trailer within 3ds max that needs to lasts 20-30 seconds. Wihtin this trailer I need to create one fully rigged and animated character, an elaborate prop and an environment.

* Initial ideas
  * Noir theme - black white and rigged
  * Rainy night
  * 1930s/40s
  * Character walking down the street
  * Character notices they are being followed
  * Turn down an ally
  * Its a trap
  * Gunned down my a Tommy Gun
  * Camera zooms out
  * Black and white contrasted by the bright red blood.

After coming up with these initial ideas I thought to create a mood board to help be get an understanding of what the 1940s were like.

After looking through my mood board and the initial ideas I had I created the following story board.
