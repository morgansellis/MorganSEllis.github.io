After completing my story board I decided to create an animatic, I have never done this before so I began looking into the process of creating an animatic. Through my research I discovered it is made
by taking sketches of what the scene may look like and create a video with the relevant sound effects. This is then processed into a video to act as a visual aid for rest of the design process. After using this knowledge I taught myself some basic Adobe After Effect skills and created this below animatic.
