For my assignment in semester one I needed to choose a topic from one of my lectures to create a video tutorial that could be used to teach someone about the subject. I choose to create a video tutorial on L-systems, the process of procedurally creating trees and other assets through predefined rules. Additionally, I created an accompanying UI so the user could input their own rules and see how the trees change. You can fallow along with the video tutorial or with this page.
