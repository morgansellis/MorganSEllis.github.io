During the first lecture of level design of semester two our assignment was told to use. We would have to create a programmer-designer pair
and create a bunker themed level that would play for a total of five minutes and we could use either Unity or UE4 to create this level. I partnered up with Jack Peedle and we instantly started getting ideas down on paper. These are our first
ideas.
Markup : * Initial Ideas
             * WW1 trench theme
             * Go on first whistle to charge no mans land
             * Cut through barbed wire
             * Reach the German bunker and there are no Germans/German Holograms
