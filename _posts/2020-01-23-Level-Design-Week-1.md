During the first lecture of level design of semester two our assignment was told to use. We would have to create a programmer-designer pair
and create a bunker themed level that would play for a total of five minutes and we could use either Unity or UE4 to create this level. I partnered up with Jack Peedle and we instantly started getting ideas down on paper. These are our first
ideas.
* Initial Ideas
  * WW1 trench theme
  * Go on first whistle to charge no mans land
  * Cut through barbed wire
  * Reach the German trench and there are no Germans/German Holograms
  * Find the German bunker and discover the German Weapons

After some more discussion we decided it would came up with a better start to the level, which goes as follow:
* Updated level
  * Subtrench
  * Allie wakes you up after being KOed
  * Explains the situation
  * Allie dies by sniper
  * Clear out sniper placement
  * Tussle with German sniper
  * Advance on trench
  * Reach the German trench and there are no Germans/German Holograms
  * Find the German bunker and discover the German Weapons

Next we needed to do some research into the types of weapons the British and Germans used during the war.
* British Inventory
  * Lee Enfield Mk3 + Bayonet
  * Rifle .303 P14
  * Lewis M1914
  * Trench Club
  * Wire Cutting
  * Mills bomb
  * Webley Revolver Mk VI
  * PO8 Small Pack
  * PO8 Water Bottle
  * S.B.R. (Small Box Respirator)
  * Entrenching Tool
  * Broadie Helmet
  * Tank Helm and Mask

* German Inventory
  * Mauser Gewehr 98 + Bayonet
  * Sturmmesser
  * Mauser C96
  * Sthalhelm M1916
  * Stiel and Kugel granaten
  * LederSchutzMaske M1917
  * Assult Backpack
  * Breadbag M1916
  * Tactical Shovel
  * Tornister M1895
  * Pickelhaube

Now we knew the assets we need to research for the scene we need to make a rough sketch of the map which Jack then digitalised into the image below.
