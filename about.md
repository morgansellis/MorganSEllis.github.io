Hi, I'm Jamie a games programmer and a lecturer on games programming a the <a href="http://www.glos.ac.uk">University of Gloucestershire</a>. 

What's this site about, well it's a bunch of programming related things that I find interesting that I haven't necessairly fit into a specific module or lecture session, or just something that I wanted to work on outside of teaching hours. So it's the spare parts or bits and pieces that I wanted to pursue further.

Any opinions expressed here are my own, and not those of any employer that I may have. That said they will all mostly be opinions about code, useless pok√©mon, and other game related things.

I don't know how frequently updates to this site will occur, sporadically at best. I've got commenting turned on, and a bunch of other things too if you need to get in touch or have questions about any of the content in here.
