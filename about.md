Hello, my name is Morgan Ellis and I am currently studying Computer Games Programming at the University of Gloucestershire.

I am currently in my second year of the course and I have decided to learn more of the design side of the industry so I have taken modules that involve 3D animations for games and level design. However, this does not mean I am not continuing
to program. This year I have been diving deeper in game engine scripting in unity, learned how to build a GBA game and I am currently in the process of learning how to use external libraries to create a boid system within c++.
